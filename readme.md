# FruitDetect

This project consists of a script that opens a camera and is able to detect and recognise three different types of fruit: Apples, bananas and lemmons. This can be used in agriculture as farmers can use this tool to detect the grown crops with a camera so they don't have to check everyday walking through the crops.



## The Algorithm

This project uses the detectnet model to identify this three fruits. It was trained with 300 images, 100 per class and 10 epochs to make it precise and accurate. This project also includes a script to run the camera and test the model.
